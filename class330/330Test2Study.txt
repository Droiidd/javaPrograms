STUDIES FOR 330 TEST 2

Tricky problems:
->Q1 - Find out what fractional knapsack problem is, slightly different than I/O
Q2A - should be O(n^2)
->Q2B - re-look into partitioning and quick sort
Q3 - Looks like a max heap, next max should be 77
	LOOK IN TO HOW TO FILTER THROUGH
	REMEMBER - must maintain a FULL tree.

Q4 - Items 2 (W :3, V :8) & Item 3 (W :5, V :10)
->Q5 - Are they both not directly recursive in nature? Look into this
Q6 - Quick sort is O(n^2), merge sort (if needed) is O(NlogN)
Q7 - take a look at number 7, this one might be tricky
     Answer : B - L child is always 2*i, whiel right is the 2*i+1. The parent of course being i/2
Q8 -
