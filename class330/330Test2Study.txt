STUDIES FOR 330 TEST 2

Tricky problems:
Q1 - Find out what fractional knapsack problem is, slightly different than I/O
Q2 - re-look into partitioning and quick sort
Q2A - should be O(n^2)
Q3 - Looks like a max heap, next max should be 77
	LOOK IN TO HOW TO FILTER THROUGH
	REMEMBER - must maintain a FULL tree.

		77
		/ \
	       68  66
	      / \  /
	      1 3  11    ???

Q5 - Are they both not directly recursive in nature? Look into this
Q6 - Quick sort is O(n^2), merge sort (if needed) is O(NlogN)
Q7 - take a look at number 7, this one might be tricky
